NA	"This study will take place in two phases. In Phase 1, you will play a game called The Boxes Game. In the Boxes Game, you will learn about risky options and make decisions.

NA	"At the end of the study, you will receive a base payment of $1. In addition, you have the opportunity to earn a bonus payment based on how many points you earn in The Boxes Game. Most participants should earn a bonus between $0.75 and $1.50 in addition to the base-payment of $1.

When you start a game, you won't know anything about each box. Over the course of the game, you can learn about boxes and earn (or lose) points by using a budget of 20 clicks"	3	p	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	0	NA	500px	NA	NA	0
